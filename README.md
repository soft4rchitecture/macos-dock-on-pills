# MacOS Dock On Pills

## My Dock is sooo slow to pop out

Provided that you have activated the auto-hide of the Dock,
When hovering over the dock position, it pops out, but quite slowly. If you're fedup with that,
this tiny project is just for you.
It provides an easy way to make the Mac OS dock pop out "instantly".

## What can I do ?

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/soft4rchitecture/macos-dock-on-pills.git`
2. At the root of the project, run: `./mac-os-dock-autohide-no-delay.sh`
3. Your dock should now pop out as quickly as possible :)
